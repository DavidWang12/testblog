This is my attempt at building a blog from scratch using Rails with what I've learned in the beginning few chapters of Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial.

As of January 11, 2012, I have finished the first five chapters which includes making relatively static pages using Rails. The dynamic parts include a Rails generated dynamic title and content for each page. I have worked a lot on the layout and HTML and CSS to make it look nice.
